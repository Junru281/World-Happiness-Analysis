# World-Happiness-Analysis
This project seeks to delve into the variations in happiness levels observed between Western Europe and other regions across the globe. Our approach involves the application of both numerical and graphical summaries to provide a clear and comprehensive depiction of these disparities. Furthermore, we have employed a two-sample t-test to meticulously assess the differences in average ladder scores, which serve as a key indicator representing happiness levels.

As we examine these disparities, we discussed potential contributing factors that underlie this variance in happiness levels. By exploring the reasons behind these differences, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the global dynamics of happiness. Looking ahead, our research also identifies and highlights several intriguing avenues for future investigation. These include additional factors, both socio-economic and cultural, that could influence happiness levels. 

We invite you to share your insights and suggestions as we continue to refine and enhance our analysis. Your feedback is invaluable to us.
